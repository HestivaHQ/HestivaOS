# Technical work log

This is the durable, detailed record of the Hestiva OS migration and production recovery. The six recovery commit identifiers below are preserved exactly even though they are not present in this checkout's reachable Git object set.

## Migration and recovery sequence

1. **`93ffb8f579ff821e8db8b3636a3419835404ef35` — initial recovery baseline.** Recovery work established a known source state and began reconciling repository identity and deployed services. The production stack was treated as three dependencies—Cloudflare web, Railway API, and Supabase—rather than attempting application changes before infrastructure health was understood.
2. **`52a9a1da92e438c518e874eeae56f60cb3a61387` — Railway workspace/build recovery.** The API deployment was aligned to the monorepo root so npm could resolve `@hestiva/api`. The verified build became `npm run build --workspace @hestiva/api`; the API remained a NestJS Railway service and its health contract remained `/api/v1/health`.
3. **`5b2670cec3e370b82489594d20b960fffe2f9549` — Railway startup and database recovery.** API startup was aligned to `npm run deploy:api`, ensuring Prisma migrations precede the process. Supabase database connectivity and environment configuration were recovered without committing values. The resulting known debt is that migrations execute twice: the root deploy script and API workspace start script both invoke deployment migrations.
4. **`dca46d1feba07445fde4eba66d73b52d79350ef5` — Cloudflare/OpenNext recovery.** The Next.js workspace was restored to an OpenNext Cloudflare Worker deployment, with the Worker identity `hestivaos`. Server and browser API configuration were separated through `API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, and required Supabase build variables were restored in the deployment environment.
5. **`ad4a9eb8b8c02c8ef105a3c7d4ab25d7971912eb` — deployment authority consolidation.** Cloudflare native Git builds were selected as the active web controller. The duplicate GitHub Actions Cloudflare workflow was disabled at the control plane, Railway web automatic deployments were disabled, and the Railway web service was retained temporarily for rollback only.
6. **`82462a6f76bb15c7e162c16d12439913654f06a1` — verification and stabilization.** Web/API reachability, Railway health, and recovered environment scopes were validated. Remaining debt was recorded rather than hidden: legacy `mmapi` in the Railway API hostname, double Prisma migration execution, absent API tests causing `npm test` to fail, and outstanding dependency review.

## Repository cleanup and review history

- **PR #34** performed the Hestiva OS technical cleanup and branding consolidation. It established the `hestiva-os`, `@hestiva/api`, and `@hestiva/web` identities and removed active legacy naming where safe without renaming the live Railway hostname.
- **PR #37** performed the repository-wide legacy naming audit and follow-up cleanup. It retained compatibility-sensitive production references intentionally and corrected local Hestiva OS database example naming.

Subsequent repository commits also corrected the Cloudflare deployment working directory and renamed the checked-in Worker configuration to `hestivaos`. The production conclusion remains: GitHub `main` is source, Cloudflare native Git owns web deployment, Railway owns API deployment, and Supabase owns database/Auth/Storage.

## Known state after recovery

- Railway API Root Directory is the repository root; build and start commands are documented in [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md).
- Cloudflare native Git builds are active. The GitHub Actions deployment path and Railway web automatic deployments are disabled.
- Railway web remains rollback-only and must be removed after confidence and rollback planning permit.
- Values were recovered into platform configuration, not committed.
- `npm test` fails because the API has no tests; this is known work, not a passing baseline.
- Dependency vulnerability review, monitoring, backups, controller cleanup verification, hostname migration, and account identity cleanup remain open.
